# Hi Lis
#### Game prototype JavaScript/jQuery version ~ 2013

Hi Lis is a platformer game with simple mechanics and short levels, whose look is inspired by pixel-art games from the 16-bit generation. The game features small puzzles and challenging levels which require good skill and mnemonic player's ability, also because it includes a major mechanical lighting that constantly changes between on and off, and on first case reveals only the platforms, and on second case only reveals the enemies. The videos show small snippets of gameplay, with the mechanics and general purpose of the game.

According to the story, the protagonist is a boy in search of a romantic outcome with his loved one, on a date in a stunning park. He must cross the dangers of the woods, including ghosts and other aberrations, and difficult paths to be followed. He does not throw strikes or have special skills, just can run and jump, and run away from enemies.
